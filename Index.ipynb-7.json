    "Since there are lots of grocery shops in Ferrara we will try to detect locations that are not already crowded with shops. We are also particularly interested in areas with no grocery shops in vicinity. We would also prefer locations as close to city center as possible, assuming that first two conditions are met.\n",
    "We will use our data science powers to generate a few most promissing neighborhoods based on this criteria. Advantages of each area will then be clearly expressed so that best possible final location can be chosen by stakeholders."
