Specifically, this report will be targeted to stakeholders interested in opening a grocery shop in Ferrara, Italy.\nSince there are lots of grocery shops in Ferrara we will try to detect locations that are not already crowded with shops. We are also particularly interested in areas with no grocery shops in vicinity. We would also prefer locations as close to city center as possible, assuming that first two conditions are met.\nWe will use our data science powers to generate a few most promissing neighborhoods based on this criteria. Advantages of each area will then be clearly expressed so that best possible final location can be chosen by stakeholders."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Data"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Based on definition of our problem, factors that will influence our decission are:\nnumber of existing grocery shops in the neighborhood \nnumber of and distance to grocery shops in the neighborhood, if any\ndistance of neighborhood from city center\nWe decided to use regularly spaced grid of locations, centered around city center, to define our neighborhoods.\nFollowing data sources will be needed to extract/generate the required information:\ncenters of candidate areas will be generated algorithmically and approximate addresses of centers of those areas will be obtained using Google Maps API reverse geocoding\nnumber of grocery shops and their type and location in every neighborhood will be obtained using Foursquare API\ncoordinate of Ferrara center will be obtained using Google Maps API geocoding of popular Ferrara sqaure (Piazza Trento Trieste)"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"name":"python3","display_name":"Python 3","language":"python"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.10","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":2}
